A Bash tool for easily and dynamically sourcing ROS and ROS2 environment.

## Installation
Download the repository to your local computer and run the setup script.
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Briancbn/ros_src_tools.git .ros_src_tools
./.ros_src_tools/setup.sh
```
Follow the instructions to setup up your `ros_src_tools`.

Note that by default, the program will search for
- ROS Installation inside `/opt/ros`
- ROS workspaces (folder ends with **_ws**) in `~/`

You can change these configurations during the setup.

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y --rosdistro "${ROS_DISTRO}"
```

Simply delete the repository you have downloaded.
```bash
rm -rf ~/.ros_src_tools
```

Delete the following lines under `~.bashrc`

```bash
# ROS source tools

  . ~/ros_src_tools/.ros_shortcut_impl.sh
fi
```
